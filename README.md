## SR-IOV Network Device Plugin

The SR-IOV Network Device Plugin is Kubernetes device plugin for discovering and advertising SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) available on a Kubernetes host.

## Features

- Handles SR-IOV capable/not-capable devices (NICs and Accelerators alike)
- Supports devices with both Kernel and userspace (UIO and VFIO) drivers
- Allows resource grouping using "Selector"
- User configurable resourceName
- Detects Kubelet restarts and auto-re-register
- Detects Link status (for Linux network devices) and updates associated VFs health accordingly
- Extensible to support new device types with minimal effort if not already supported
- Works within virtual deployments of Kubernetes that do not have virtualized-iommu support (VFIO No-IOMMU support)

To deploy workloads with SR-IOV VF this plugin needs to work together with the following two CNI components:

- Any CNI meta plugin supporting Device Plugin based network provisioning (Multus CNI, or DANM)

  - Retrieves allocated network device information of a Pod

- SR-IOV CNI

  - During Pod creation, plumbs allocated SR-IOV VF to a Pods network namespace using VF information given by the meta plugin

  - On Pod deletion, reset and release the VF from the Pod


Please follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) for multi network interface support in Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

### Creating SR-IOV Virtual Functions

Before starting the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin you will need to create SR-IOV Virtual Functions on your system. [The VF Setup doc will guide you through that process.](docs/vf-setup.md)

### Install SR-IOV CNI

See the [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni) repository for build and installation instructions. Supported from SR-IOV CNI release 2.0+.

### Get SR-IOV Network Device Plugin container image
#### GitHub
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin:latest
```

#### Build image locally
```
$ make image
```
> On a successful build, a docker image with tag `ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin:latest` will be created. You will need to build this image on each node. Alternatively, you could use a local docker registry to host this image.

### Install SR-IOV Network Device Plugin
#### Deploy config map
Create a ConfigMap that defines SR-IOV resource pool configuration

> Make sure to update the 'config.json' entry in the configMap data to reflect your resource configuration for the device plugin. See [Configurations](#configurations) section for supported configuration parameters.

```
$ kubectl create -f deployments/configMap.yaml
```
#### Deploy daemonset
```
$ kubectl create -f deployments/k8s-v1.16/sriovdp-daemonset.yaml
```
> For K8s version v1.15 or earlier use `deployments/k8s-v1.10-v1.15/sriovdp-daemonset.yaml` instead.


### Install one compatible CNI meta plugin
A compatible CNI meta-plugin installation is required for SR-IOV CNI plugin to be able to get allocated VF's deviceID in order to configure it.

#### Option 1 - Multus

##### Install Multus
Please refer to Multus [Quickstart Installation Guide](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni#quickstart-installation-guide) to install Multus.

##### Network Object CRDs

Multus uses Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) for defining additional network attachements. These network attachment CRDs follow the standards defined by K8s Network Plumbing Working Group(NPWG). Please refer to [Multus documentation](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
1. Create the SR-IOV Network CRD
```
$ kubectl create -f deployments/sriov-crd.yaml
```

#### Option 2 - DANM
This section explains an example deployment of SR-IOV Network Device Plugin in Kubernetes if you choose DANM as your meta plugin.

##### Install DANM
Refer to [DANM deployment documentation](https://github.com/nokia/danm/blob/master/deployment-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

##### Create SR-IOV type networks
DANM supports the Device Plugin based SR-IOV provisioning with the dynamic level.
Refer to the [DAMN User Guide documentation](https://github.com/nokia/danm/blob/master/user-guide.md) for detailed instructions.
For example manifest objects refer to [SR-IOV demo](https://github.com/nokia/danm/tree/master/example/device_plugin_demo)

> See following sections on how to configure and run SR-IOV Network Device Plugin.

## Configurations

### Config parameters

This plugin creates device plugin endpoints based on the configurations given in the config map associated with the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin. In json format this file appears as shown below:

```json
{
    "resourceList": [{
            "resourceName": "intel_sriov_netdevice",
            "selectors": {

            }
        }

    ]
}
```

`"resourceList"` should contain a list of config objects. Each config object may consist of following fields:


|      Field       | Required |                                                    Description                                                    |                     Type/Defaults                     |                     Example/Accepted values                     |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| "resourceName"   | Y        | Endpoint resource name. Should not contain special characters including hyphens and must be unique in the scope of the resource prefix | string                                                | "sriov_net_A"                                                   |

#### Extended selectors for device type "accelerator"
This selector is applicable when "deviceType" is "accelerator". The "accelerator" device type currently supports only the common selectors.

### Command line arguments

This plugin accepts the following optional run-time command line arguments:

```bash
./sriovdp --help

Usage of ./sriovdp:
  -alsologtostderr
        log to standard error as well as files
  -config-file string
        JSON device pool config file location (default "/etc/pcidp/config.json")
  -log_backtrace_at value
        when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
  -log_dir string
        If non-empty, write log files in this directory
  -logtostderr
        log to standard error instead of files
  -resource-prefix string
        resource name prefix used for K8s extended resource (default "intel.com")
  -stderrthreshold value
        logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
  -v value
        log level for V logs
  -vmodule value
        comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
```

### Assumptions

This plugin does not bind or unbind any driver to any device whether it's PFs or VFs. It also doesn't create Virtual functions either. Usually, the virtual functions are created at boot time when kernel module for the device is loaded. Required device drivers could be loaded on system boot-up time by allow-listing/deny-listing the right modules. But plugin needs to be aware of the driver type of the resources (i.e. devices) that it is registering as K8s extended resource so that it's able to create appropriate Device Specs for the requested resource.

For example, if the driver type is uio (i.e. igb_uio.ko) then there are specific device files to add in Device Spec. For vfio-pci, device files are different. And if it is Linux kernel network driver then there is no device file to be added.

The idea here is, user creates a resource config for each resource pool as shown in [Config parameters](#config-parameters) by specifying the resource name, a list resource "selectors".

The device plugin will initially discover all PCI network resources in the host and populate an initial "device list". Each "resource pool" then applies its selectors on this list and add devices that satisfies the selector's constraints. Each selector narrows down the list of devices for the resource pool. Currently, the selectors are applied in following order:

1. "vendors"      - The vendor hex code of device
2. "devices"      - The device hex code of device
3. "drivers"      - The driver name the device is registered with
4. "pciAddresses" - The pci address of the device in BDF notation
4. "pfNames"      - The Physical function name
5. "rootDevices"  - The Physical function PCI address
6. "linkTypes"    - The link type of the net device associated with the PCI device.

The "pfNames" and "rootDevices" selectors can be used to specify a list and/or range of VFs for a pool in the below format:
````
"<PFName>#<SingleVF>,<FirstVF>-<LastVF>,<SingleVF>,<SingleVF>,<FirstVF>-<LastVF>"
````

Or

````
"<RootDevice>#<SingleVF>,<FirstVF>-<LastVF>,<SingleVF>,<SingleVF>,<FirstVF>-<LastVF>"
````

Where:

    `<PFName>`     - is the PF interface name
    `<RootDevice>` - is the PF PCI address
    `<SingleVF>`   - is a single VF index (0-based) that is included into the pool
    `<FirstVF>`    - is the first VF index (0-based) that is included into the range
    `<LastVF>`     - is the last VF index (0-based) that is included into the range

Example:

The selector for interface named `netpf0` and VF 0, 2 upto 7 (included 2 and 7) and 9 will look like:
````
"pfNames": ["netpf0#0,2-7,9"]
````
The selector for PCI address `0000:86:00.0` and VF 0, 1, 3, 4 will look like:
````
"rootDevices": ["0000:86:00.0#0-1,3,4"]
````
If only PF network interface or PF PCI address is specified in the selector, then assuming that all VFs of this interface are going to the pool.


### Workflow

- Load device's (Physical function if it is SR-IOV capable) kernel module and bind the driver to the PF
- Create required Virtual functions
- Bind all VF with right drivers
- Create a resource config map
- Run SR-IOV Network Device Plugin (as daemonset)

On successful run, the allocatable resource list for the node should be updated with resource discovered by the plugin as shown below. Note that the resource name is appended with the `-resource-prefix` i.e. `"intel.com/sriov_net_A"`.

```json
$ kubectl get node node1 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable'

{
  "cpu": "8",
  "ephemeral-storage": "169986638772",
  "hugepages-1Gi": "0",
  "hugepages-2Mi": "8Gi",
  "intel.com/sriov_net_A": "8",
  "intel.com/sriov_net_B": "8",
  "memory": "7880620Ki",
  "pods": "1k"
}

```
## Example deployments

We assume that you have working K8s cluster configured with one of the supported meta plugins for multi-network support. Please see [Features](#features) and [Quick Start](#quick-start) sections for more information on required CNI plugins.

### Deploy the Device Plugin
The [images](./images) directory contains example Dockerfile, sample specs along with build scripts to deploy the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin as daemonset. Please see [README.md](./images/README.md) for more information about the Docker images.

### Deploy SR-IOV workloads when DANM is used
#### Verify the existence of the example SR-IOV networks

````
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl get dnet -n example-sriov
NAME         AGE
management   6s
sriov-a      14m
sriov-b      13m
````

#### Connect your networks to existing SR-IOV Device Pools
The Spec.Options.device_pool mandatory parameter denotes the Device Pool used by the network.
Make sure this parameter is set to the name(s) of your existing SR-IOV Device Pool(s)!

````
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl describe node 172.31.3.154 | grep -A8 Allocatable
Allocatable:

#### Deploy demo Pod connecting to pre-created SR-IOV networks
First, make sure that your Pod asks appropriate number of Devices from the right Device Pools:

````
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ grep -B1 sriov_ sriov_pod.yaml
      requests:
        nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1: '2'
      limits:
        nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1: '2'
````

Then instantiate the Pod:

````
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl create -f sriov_pod.yaml
pod/sriov-pod created
````

#### Verify status and the network connections of the demo Pod

````
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl get pod sriov-pod -n example-sriov
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sriov-pod   1/1     Running   0          111s

[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl exec -n example-sriov -it sriov-pod -- ip addr show

### Pod device information

The allocated device information is exported in Container's environment variable. The variable name is `PCIDEVICE_` appended with full extended resource name (e.g. intel.com/sriov etc.) which is capitailzed and any special characters (".", "/") are replaced with underscore ("_"). In case of multiple devices from same extended resource pool, the device IDs are delimited with commas (",").

For example, if 2 devices are allocated from `intel.com/sriov` extended resource then the allocated device information will be found in following env variable:
`PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_SRIOV=0000:03:02.1,0000:03:04.3`


## Virtual Deployments Support

### Configure Device Plugin extended selectors in virtual environments

SR-IOV Network Device Plugin supports running in a virtualized environment.  However, not all device selectors are
applicable as the VFs are passthrough to the VM without any association to their respective PF, hence any device
selector that relies on the association between a VF and its PF will not work and therefore the _pfNames_ and
_rootDevices_ extended selectors will not work in a virtual deployment.  The common selector _pciAddress_ can be
used to select the virtual device.

## CNI plugins in virtual environments

SR-IOV CNI plugin doesn't support running in a virtualized environment since it always requires accessing to PF device
which usually doesn't exist in VM. The recommended CNI plugin to use in a virtualized environment is the [host-device](https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/main/host-device/) CNI plugin.

### Virtual environments with no iommu

SR-IOV Network Device Plugin supports allocating VFIO devices in a virtualized environment without a virtualized iommu.
For more information refer to [this](./docs/dpdk/README-virt.md).
